# Pixel Perfect Replica

> AI-Powered Visual Analysis Platform for investigating events through evidence collection, hypothesis testing, and narrative branching using Google Gemini API

## Overview

Pixel Perfect Replica is a sophisticated web application that combines AI-powered visual analysis with interactive 3D timeline visualization to help users investigate complex events. The platform enables users to:

- Create and manage investigations with multiple narrative branches
- Upload and analyze evidence using Google Gemini AI
- Automatically detect objects and assess credibility
- Generate and test hypotheses across different narrative interpretations
- Visualize evidence relationships in an interactive 3D timeline
- Collaborate in real-time with other investigators

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- shadcn/ui for accessible UI components
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- React Three Fiber for 3D timeline visualization
- TanStack React Query for server state management
- React Router for client-side routing

### Backend
- Supabase for backend-as-a-service
- PostgreSQL database with real-time subscriptions
- Supabase Edge Functions using Deno runtime
- Row-level security for data protection

### AI Integration
- Google Gemini API for multimodal AI analysis
- Object detection with bounding box visualization
- Credibility assessment algorithms
- Narrative relevance scoring
- Cross-validation flagging

## Core Features

### Investigation Management
Create investigations to track complex events with title, description, and status tracking through multiple phases.

### Evidence Collection
Add various types of evidence including text, images, links, and documents. Each piece of evidence is automatically analyzed by Gemini AI.

### AI Analysis
Automatic analysis of evidence includes object detection, credibility scoring, narrative relevance assessment, and cross-validation flags.

### Narrative Branches
Create multiple narrative branches to explore different interpretations of the same evidence set.

### 3D Timeline Visualization
Interactive Three.js-based timeline showing evidence nodes across different branches with timeline position visualization.

### Hypothesis Testing
Generate and test hypotheses with supporting and refuting evidence linkage.

## API Endpoints

### Supabase Edge Functions
- marathon-investigator: Orchestrates multi-phase AI investigation process

### Database Tables
- events: Investigation events and status
- branches: Narrative interpretation branches
- evidence: Evidence items with AI analysis
- hypotheses: Generated and user-created hypotheses
- investigation_logs: Audit trail of investigation actions
- merges: Branch merge operations and conflict resolution

## Getting Started

The application requires Node.js 18+, a Supabase account, and a Google Gemini API key. Configure environment variables for Supabase URL and publishable key, then run the development server on port 8080.
